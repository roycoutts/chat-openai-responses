'    i need vbscript code to launch a powershell script silently
'
'    AI:
'    You can use the `CreateObject` method to create a `WScript.Shell` object in VBScript, and then use its `Run` method to 
'    execute a PowerShell script silently. Here's an example:
'

Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
objShell.Run "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Scripts\MyScript.ps1", 0, True

'
'    AI:
'    In this example, replace "C:\Scripts\MyScript.ps1" with the path to your PowerShell script.
'
'    The `0` parameter passed as the second argument to the `Run` method specifies that the window should be hidden. The 
'    `True` parameter passed as the third argument specifies that the script should wait for the command to complete 
'    before continuing.
'
'    Note that the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` parameter is used to bypass the execution policy set on the machine. This can 
'    be a security risk, so use it with caution.
