    AI:
    You can use the following PowerShell script to relaunch the current script as an administrator if it was originally 
    launched without administrator privileges:
#>

# Check if script is running as administrator
if (-not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {
    
    # If not running as administrator, relaunch the script with elevated privileges
    Start-Process powershell.exe -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList "-File `"$($MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path)`""
    
    # Exit the current instance of the script
    Exit
}

# Your script code goes here...

<#
    Here's how it works:

    1. The script first checks if it is running with administrative privileges by using the `WindowsPrincipal` and 
       `WindowsIdentity` classes to get the current user's identity and checking if it is a member of the `Administrator` 
       built-in role.
    2. If the script is not running with administrative privileges, it relaunches itself using `Start-Process` with the 
       `-Verb RunAs` parameter to run as an administrator, and passes the current script path as an argument using the 
       `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` variable.
    3. The current instance of the script then exits using the `Exit` command.
    4. If the script is running with administrative privileges, it skips the relaunching step and continues with the 
       rest of your script code.

    Note that this method may not work in some scenarios, such as when running the script from a PowerShell Integrated 
    Scripting Environment (ISE) session or when using some third-party PowerShell hosts.
