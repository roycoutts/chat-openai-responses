    To create a point-to-point connection between two PowerShell scripts and enable bidirectional communication, you 
    can use PowerShell remoting. PowerShell remoting allows you to execute PowerShell commands on remote computers, and 
    can be used to establish a connection between two PowerShell sessions on different computers. Here's an example of 
    two PowerShell scripts that can create a point-to-point connection between them and communicate bidirectionally:

    First Script:
#>

# Set the name or IP address of the remote computer
$remoteComputer = "192.168.1.100"

# Create a new PowerShell session on the remote computer
$remoteSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $remoteComputer

# Import the session into the current session
Import-PSSession $remoteSession -AllowClobber

# Define a function to send a message to the remote session
function SendMessage($message) {
    Invoke-Command -Session $remoteSession -ScriptBlock {
        $global:ReceivedMessage = $args[0]
    } -ArgumentList $message
}

# Define a function to receive a message from the remote session
function ReceiveMessage() {
    Invoke-Command -Session $remoteSession -ScriptBlock {
        return $global:ReceivedMessage
    }
}

# Send a message to the remote session
SendMessage "Hello, remote session!"

# Receive a message from the remote session
$message = ReceiveMessage

# Display the message received from the remote session
Write-Host "Received message: $message"

# Remove the imported session
Remove-PSSession $remoteSession

<#
    AI:
    Second Script:
#>

# Set the name or IP address of the remote computer
$remoteComputer = "192.168.1.101"

# Create a new PowerShell session on the remote computer
$remoteSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $remoteComputer

# Import the session into the current session
Import-PSSession $remoteSession -AllowClobber

# Define a function to send a message to the remote session
function SendMessage($message) {
    Invoke-Command -Session $remoteSession -ScriptBlock {
        $global:ReceivedMessage = $args[0]
    } -ArgumentList $message
}

# Define a function to receive a message from the remote session
function ReceiveMessage() {
    Invoke-Command -Session $remoteSession -ScriptBlock {
        return $global:ReceivedMessage
    }
}

# Receive a message from the remote session
$message = ReceiveMessage

# Display the message received from the remote session
Write-Host "Received message: $message"

# Send a message to the remote session
SendMessage "Hello, remote session!"

# Remove the imported session
Remove-PSSession $remoteSession

<#
    AI: 
    In these scripts, each PowerShell session creates a connection to the other session using `New-PSSession`. The 
    sessions are imported into the current session using `Import-PSSession`, which allows you to run commands on the 
    remote session.

    The `SendMessage` function sends a message to the remote session using `Invoke-Command` with the `-Session` 
    parameter. The `ReceiveMessage` function receives a message from the remote session using `Invoke-Command`.

    The first script sends a message to the second script using `SendMessage`, and then receives a message from the 
    second script using `ReceiveMessage`. The second script receives a message from the first script using 
    `ReceiveMessage`, and then sends a message to the first script using `SendMessage`. This enables bidirectional 
    communication between the two PowerShell sessions.
